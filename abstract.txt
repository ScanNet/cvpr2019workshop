3D scene understanding for indoor environments is becoming an increasingly important area. Application domains such as augmented and virtual reality, computational photography, interior design, and autonomous mobile robots all require a deep understanding of 3D interior spaces, the semantics of objects that are present, and their relative configurations in 3D space.

We present the first comprehensive challenge for 3D scene understanding of entire rooms at the object instance-level with 5 tasks based on the ScanNet dataset. The ScanNet dataset is a large-scale semantically annotated dataset of 3D mesh reconstructions of interior spaces (approx. 1500 rooms and 2.5 million RGB-D frames). It is used by more than 480 research groups to develop and benchmark state-of-the-art approaches in semantic scene understanding. A key goal of this challenge is to compare state-of-the-art approaches operating on image data (including RGB-D) with approaches operating directly on 3D data (point cloud, or surface mesh representations). Additionally, we pose both object category label prediction (commonly referred to as semantic segmentation), and instance-level object recognition (object instance prediction and category label prediction).
